# I wrote this code in Jupyter Notebook but there's some issue with github showing .ipynb files(thread already opened -> https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11). 
#So, I am changing the extension from .ipynb to .py so that if anyone wants, he/she can see the code easily
